# Unsupported Transaction Types

The examples found here illustrate how these transaction types could be implemented,  
as well as why they are not supported.

These are **not** final, tested, or guaranteed as working;  
however, this should help make implementation easier when needed--if ever.

## What's currently here

* Type 1: Second Signature Registration
* Type 2: Delegate Registration
* Type 6: MultiPayment
* Type 7: Delegate Resignation
